## **STEP 1: Formalin Fixing Protocol**

[reference] (<https://www.surrey.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Formalin-Fixative.pdf>)

To adjust the 10% formalin solution to a neutral pH you would need to mix in quantities of a buffer, typically sodium phosphate.

A recommended recipe is as follows:

-   100 mL formalin(37-40% stock solution)

-   900 mL water (preferrably distilled)

-   4 g/L NaH2PO4 (monobasic)

-   6.5 g/L Na2HPO4(dibasic/anhydrous)

-make incision on side of specimen so solution fully penetrates and fixes all tissue

-leave 6-24 hours

### Bill's Way

-   10% buffered formalin solution

    -   lay fish flat; let fish fix for a few days (small fish; larger fish should have bellies cut open or injected with formalin so it reaches the interior of the specimen, good after about a week)

\~\~*dehydration*\~\~

-   after fixing, place fish into water to remove any formalin in it (length in water depends on size of fish, but lasts up to 2 days for large specimens)

-   transfer to ethanol (typically 70%); alternatively, use 50% isopropyl alcohol.

## Wish List 

-   formalin 37%-40% - 1 L - [#8187081000](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/mm/818708?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organicshopping&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=20790375250&utm_content=154400301983&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2ou2BhCCARIsANAwM2Had4Um0n7c1kHjf-a4ZsmS_XakWjoOtj23gW5CTDrIgsnDDUAt7doaAqcGEALw_wcB) \$40.10

-   Sodium phosphate monobasic NAH2PO4 - 100 g [#S0751-100G](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sial/s0751) \$25.60

-   Sodium phosphate dibasic NAH2PO4 - 100 g [\# S0876-100G](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sial/s0876) \$39

-   water - free

    -   \^this should be good for at least 10 L of 10% buffered formalin solution (plenty of buffer NAH2PO4s leftover for next 10L)

    -   need fume hood when handling formaldehyde

    -   PPE: lab coat, gloves, glasses/goggles
